# NativeBash
Native tools written with bash and the most basic linux tools.

Why? Because sometimes you don not have control over what tools are availble on a system ... but you always have bash (in Linux, that is). Plus it's a fun challenge.

Note: I've relocated 'MultiSCP' to the 'UsefulTools' repository. I really want to keep this repository with tools which, at their core, operate stricktly within bash built-ins.
